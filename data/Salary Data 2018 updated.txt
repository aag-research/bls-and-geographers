"*For these occupations, BLS website reports that wages for top 10% were equal to or greater than $145,600 for the years 2005-2007, and $166,400 for 2008-2010, and $187,199 for 2011-2013, $208,000 for 2014 - 2016."																												
"**Some projected job openings (mainly postsecondary teachers) refer to industry-wide figures, rather than figures for the individual occupations"																												
"***These occupational titles are based on the O*NET/SOC 2009 taxonomy, the structure of which reflects the 2000 SOC system developed by the BLS. While these occupational titles do not appear in the SOC, they are directly derived from similar SOC occupational titles and use the same data for median annual income, projected growth, projected job openings, and top industries.
